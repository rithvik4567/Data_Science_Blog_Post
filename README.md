## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Here are some of the following libraries you may need to install
-pandas
-matplotlib
-sklearn

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using World Bank Databank data from to better understand:

1. How different countries differ when it comes to GDP
2. Which features do or do not contribute heavily to a country's GDP
3. Is it possible to predict countries based off of GDP and other measureable features


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
GDP.ipynb - This file is a notebook that contains all the caluclations, results, observations, etc. This is where I cleaned and transformed the dataset and created/ran the models used to obtain results. 

GDPData.csv - This is the csv file that I loaded in from the World Bank Databank. This csv contains the data in a wide format csv.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@rithvik4567/how-education-internet-usage-and-health-tell-the-bigger-story-of-a-countrys-economic-health-eaba674e0b12).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to World Bank Databank for the data. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
